Setup the Environment Manager Tutorial
======================================

Initial Setup
-------------

    1.  Pull down any changes from the "main" branch on GitHub

    2.  Run the following code in the "config" dir

            . setup.sh

    3.  This should be your environment set up, activate, and ready to go. Use the following commands to install packages:

            pip install _package_           (preferred)
            
            conda install _package_


Reactivating the environment
----------------------------

    1.  Run the following code in the "config" dir

            . activate_env.sh

    2.  This should be your environment activated


Saving your installed packages
------------------------------

    1.  Run the following code as you usually would when committing changes:

        git commit -m "ENTER YOUR COMMIT MESSAGE HERE"

        (Saving the installed packages requires no more commands, but requires more documentation for clarity.)


        IMPORTANT
        ---------

        When writing your commit messages remember to add in which packages you installed during these changes.
        When you have written your commit if you use SHIFT + ENTER then you can get a new line to specify
        added packages, then close the message with the usual ".
